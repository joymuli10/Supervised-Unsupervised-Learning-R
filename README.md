# Supervised-Unsupervised-Learning-R
The repository contains two projects that demonstrate various models of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning using R.

# Project Description
## Clicking on ads prediction
This is a study that seeks to identify which individual clicks on advertisements. An entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would like to advertise it on her blog. The data to be used was previously collected by the entrepreneur while advertising related courses on the blog. The data has 1000 rows and 10 columns. The columns are age, gender, city, country, clicked on ad, area income, timestamp, daily internet usage, ad topic line and daily time spent on site. The study uses various supervised learning algorithms to identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 

## Customer Characteristics
This study seeks to understand customer's behaviour. Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores. The brand's Sales and Marketing team has provided the dataset that contains 12330 rows and  18  columns. The columns include; administrative, informational, product related, bounce rate, exit rate, page value among others. The study uses unsupervised learning and specifically K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering to learn the characteristics of customer groups.
